    "Ans:- The main purpose of object oriented programing is to reduce the complexity of program by dividing it into the multiple functions according to multiple task.Object Oriented Programming is a way of computer programming using the idea of “objects” to represents data and methods. It is also, an approach used for creating neat and reusable code instead of a redundant one. the program is divided into self-contained objects or several mini-programs. Every Individual object represents a different part of the application having its own logic and data to communicate within themselves.\n",
    "several modules can be created using data and method which can be reusable further after calling.It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."
